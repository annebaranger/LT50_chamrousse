# Introduction

This document aims at uploading and reshaping datasets from two different experiments.

The first is the measurement of seedlings over 3 altitudinal gradients.

The second is the measure of frost resistance trait over one of these gradient.

# LT50

```{r DataLoading}
data_LT50 <- read.csv2("data/LT50.csv")
```


# Seedlings

```{r DataLoading2}
data_plot <- read.csv("data/coord_placettes.csv")
data_adult <- read.csv("data/data_adult_clean.csv")
data_seedling <- read.csv("data/data_seedling_clean.csv")
data_lux <- read.csv("data/data_clim_clean.csv")
```
